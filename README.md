Bootstrap for Shoes!

Why boots? Because someday we want people to be able to use Shoes to make an app for their smartphone / tablet.
That means your Shoes app could end up displayed on any screen at any resolution. Luckily the clever kids at
Twitter already solved this problem via [bootstrap](www.getbootstrap.com).

So write your nice Shoes app with a little touch of bootstrap magic and soon you'll be mobile-ready!
